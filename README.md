Introduction
The Content-Based Movie Recommendation System is a personalized application that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. By leveraging data science and machine learning, this system helps users navigate through the overwhelming number of choices available and find movies that match their tastes.

Features
User registration and login functionality.
Movie recommendations tailored to user preferences.
Ability to view recommendation history.
Interactive and user-friendly interface built using Streamlit.

Technologies Used
Python: Backend logic and data processing.
Pandas: For data cleaning and manipulation.
Scikit-learn: Used for machine learning algorithms (cosine similarity).
Streamlit: Framework for creating the user interface.
Database: SQLite for user authentication and storing recommendation history.

System Architecture
Hereâ€™s the high-level workflow of the system:

User Registration/Login:
Users register with their details and log in to access the system.

Preference Collection:
Users input preferences such as genre, cast, or favorite directors.

Recommendation Generation:
Using content-based filtering, movies similar to user preferences are recommended.

Recommendation History:
Users can view previously recommended movies in their history.
